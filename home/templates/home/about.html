            <h3>Background, Qualifications and Experience</h3>
            <p>
                With 20 years experience teaching Physical Education in Ireland, I constantly came across students and
                athletes who
                were ill-informed about the proper nutrition needs and requirements for their own individual situation.
                So
                often, I
                heard stories of misguided coaches, parents giving advice that was not evidence-based. I completed a
                Masters. I have
                worked with Galway WFC, Galway Corinthians Rugby, Connacht Women's Rugby, Colga FC, Bray Emmets GAA,
                individual athletes.
